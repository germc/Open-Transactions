/*
 
 I figured this one out, it's easy.
 
 Someone creates a contract that contains 10 sub-contracts. It just delegates the issuence to the sub-issuers.
 
 When he connects to the server he can upload the contract, but he has no control over it at that point, 
 since he is not one of the real issuers.
 
 The contract will only work if the sub-issuers actually have issued currencies on that transaction server.
 
 Then, the transaction server itself becomes the "issuer" of the basket currency.  It simply creates an issuer
 account, and stores a list of sub-accounts to store the delegated cuts of "real" currencies.
 
 For example, if I issue a currency that is 1 part dollar, 1 part gold, and 1 part silver, then the server
 creates an issuer account in "goldbucks" and then ANY other user can create a "goldbucks" asset account and 
 trade it like any other asset.  It doesn't even have to be a special account that the trader uses. It's just
 a normal account, but the asset type ID links to the special basket issuer account maintained by the server.
 
 Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the server's "goldbucks" issuer account is not OTAccount, but derived from it.
 suppose derived from OTAccount, that contains a list of 3 sub-accounts, 1 denominated in the dollar asset
 specified in the contract, 1 denominiated in the gold asset, and so on.
 
 The OTAssetBasket contract (with sub-issuers) and the OTBasketAccount (issuer account) objects handle all the
 details of converting between the sub-accounts and the main account.
 
 If I am trading in goldbucks, and I have 9 goldbucks in my goldbucks account, then the goldbucks issuer account 
 (controlled by the transaction server) must have at least -9 on its balance due to me. And its hidden 3 sub-accounts
 have at least +3 dollars, +3 gold, and +3 silver stored along with the rest that make up their total balances from
 all the users of that basket currency.
